## about me

I'm Jasper,

The little guy slightly to the right from the centre in the picture me.jpg is me.
I would like for you to guess who I am based on this picture.

![this is me](me.jpg)

I enjoy coding and other computer related stuff.
I've been cursed/blessed with dyslexia.
Which has both good and bad sides and i hope it doesn't hinder me this course.

I'm looking forward to learning from this
